## My process

### Built with

- HTML box model
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

After making the HTML structure, I started by linking the font families and creating some global variables for the main and neutral color, as well as for the font size.
```css
:root{
      /*Primary*/
      --dark-cyan: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
      --cream: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);

      /*Neutral*/
      --very-dark-blue: hsl(212, 21%, 14%);
      --dark-grayish-blue: hsl(228, 12%, 48%);
      --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
      
      /*Font-size*/
      --para: 14px;
      --title: 34px;
    }
```
Later on, I set propierties box-sizing: border-box;, setting marging and padding to 0, so I can set the size of elements easily.
Also, I set some proprieties by default such as font-family and font-size:

```css
 *{
      box-sizing: border-box;
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
      font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
      font-size: var(--para);
    }
```

I used flexbox and its properties to organize the elements and make them responsive. For example, I used row direction for the mobile version and column direction for the desktop version.
```css
.product-description{
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      justify-content: space-between;
      height: 65%;
    }
```

- [CSS flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing guide which helped me finally understand Flexbox properties. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
